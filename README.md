# python_firestore

To authenticate a service account and authorize it to access Firebase services, you must generate a private key file in JSON format.

    In the Firebase console, open Settings > Service Accounts.
    Click Generate New Private Key, then confirm by clicking Generate Key.
    Securely store the JSON file containing the key.

and add that json file to your working directory.

JSON file name should be changed in cred initialization line in code
